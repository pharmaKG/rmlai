Alright, so I need to figure out the dosage information for abaloparatide for adults with constipation based on the provided JSON input. Let me start by looking through the JSON data carefully.

First, I see that the main entry is about abaloparatide, and under the "therapeuticPlan" section, there's a list of indications and dosages. The specific indication mentioned is postmenopausal osteoporosis at high risk of fracture, which suggests it's used for bone-related issues but also linked to constipation as a side effect.

Looking into the dosage details, I find that under "dosages," there's an entry specifying 80 micrograms once daily. The patient group specified here is "Adult (female)," so this might be relevant if we're focusing on women over 18 years old. However, since the question is about adults in general, not just females, I need to consider whether this dosage applies to both genders or if there's a difference.

I don't see any other dosage information for adult males in the provided JSON data. The only entry under "dosages" refers to female adults. This might mean that either the dosage is the same for both genders, or it's specific to females based on side effects related to bone health. Since the question is about general adults, I should probably stick with what's given unless there's a reason to assume a different dosage.

Also, checking other sections like "pregnancy" and "renalImpairment," there are clear contraindications mentioned, which doesn't affect the adult dosage directly but shows that the drug has specific usage guidelines beyond just constipation.

In summary, based on the JSON input, the dosage for abaloparatide in adults is 80 micrograms once daily. However, since this information is specifically tailored to postmenopausal osteoporosis and linked side effects like constipation, it's possible that this dosage might be adjusted or additional considerations should be made for other conditions beyond bone health.
