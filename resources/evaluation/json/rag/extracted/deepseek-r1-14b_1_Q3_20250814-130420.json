Okay, so I need to figure out whether co-trimoxazole can be given while breastfeeding. Let me start by looking at the provided JSON data.

First, I see that under the "breastFeeding" section, there's a "generalInfo" entry: "May cause complications in jaundiced neonates and infants." That suggests that co-trimoxazole might not be safe for newborns who are jaundiced. But does this mean it's unsafe for all breastfeeding situations?

I don't see any specific information about whether the drug is excreted in breast milk or if there are known risks to the infant from exposure. The general info only mentions complications in jaundiced neonates, but doesn't provide a clear answer on whether it's contraindicated during breastfeeding.

Since the data doesn't explicitly say that co-trimoxazole should be avoided by breastfeeding mothers, except for the specific case of jaundiced infants, I can't definitively say "no." It might be safer to err on the side of caution, but without more information, it's hard to make a clear recommendation.

Therefore, based on the given data, the answer is unknown because there isn't enough specific information about co-trimoxazole and breastfeeding beyond the jaundiced neonates concern.

```json
{
    "answer": "unknown",
    "explanation": "The provided information only mentions that co-trimoxazole may cause complications in jaundiced neonates and infants, but does not explicitly state whether it can be given during breastfeeding or provide specific guidance on its use."
}
