Alright, so the user is asking about the dosage of amlodipine for an adult with hypertension. Let me look through the provided JSON data to find the relevant information.

First, I'll check the structure of the JSON. It has various sections like breastFeeding, hepaticImpairment, etc., but the key part here is the therapeuticPlan section. 

In the therapeuticPlan array, there's an object with indications including Hypertension and Angina. Under dosages, there's a patientGroup specified as "adult". The doseInfo field says "10 mg once daily".

So, for an adult with hypertension, the dosage amount is 10 mg, and it's taken once daily by mouth. I don't see any additional information that would change this standard dosage, so I can confidently provide these values.

```json
{
    "dosage amount": "10",
    "dosage unit": "mg"
}
