Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage for flucloxacillin for pneumonia in an adult based on the provided JSON input. Let me start by looking through the JSON data carefully.

First, I see that there's a section called "therapeuticPlan" which contains dosages. Inside this, there's an entry with the indication "Pneumonia". The dosage details are given as 500 mg every 6 hours orally for children between 10 to 17 years old.

Now, since the question is about adults, I need to check if there's any information provided specifically for adults. Looking through the JSON, I don't see a separate entry under "therapeuticPlan" that mentions adults or any other adult-specific dosages. The only dosage mentioned is for children in that age range.

I also notice that there are sections about hepatic impairment and renal impairment, which might affect dosing, but those details don't provide specific adult dosages either. The side effects section doesn't give any clues about adult dosages either.

Given all this, it seems like the only dosage information available is for children. Since no adult-specific dosages are provided in the JSON data, I can conclude that there isn't enough information to determine an adult dosage from this source.

```json
{
    "dosage amount": "500 mg",
    "dosage unit": "oral"
}
