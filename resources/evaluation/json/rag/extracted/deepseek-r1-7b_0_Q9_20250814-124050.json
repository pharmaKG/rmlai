Alright, so I need to figure out the dosage amount and unit for abacavir in HIV infection for an adult based on the provided JSON input. Let me start by looking through the JSON data carefully.

First, I see that the JSON has several sections under different categories like breastfeeding, hepatic impairment, pregnancy, etc., but what I'm interested in is the "therapeuticPlan" section because that's where the dosages are listed.

Looking at the therapeuticPlan array, there's one entry for an adult. The dosage information says "600 mg daily." So that seems straightforward. But wait, I should make sure if this is per day or just a single dose. The term "daily" suggests it's 600 mg each day.

Now, the question asks for both the dosage amount and the dosage unit. In this case, the dosage amount is 600 mg, and since it's taken daily, the unit would be milligrams per day (mg/d). But sometimes dosages are given as a single dose with instructions on how often to take it. Here, it says "daily," so I think specifying mg/d makes sense.

I should also check if there are any other relevant sections that might affect this dosage. The sections about breastfeeding and hepatic impairment mention that abacavir is present in breast milk but recommend not breastfeeding for HIV-positive mothers due to risk of transmission. However, since the question is specifically about adults, this information doesn't directly impact the adult dosage.

Similarly, the sections on pregnancy and renal impairment also provide context but don't change the adult dosage amount. The specific info under pregnancy mentions that use in utero exposure can affect infants, which again relates to safe usage during pregnancy but not to the adult dose itself.

So, putting it all together, the dosage for an adult is 600 mg taken daily. Therefore, the dosage amount is 600 mg, and the unit is milligrams per day (mg/d).
