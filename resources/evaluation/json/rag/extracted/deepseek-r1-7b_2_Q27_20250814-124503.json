Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage for pregabalin for an adult with generalized anxiety disorder based on the provided JSON input. Let me start by looking through the JSON data carefully.

First, I see that there's a section called "therapeuticPlan" which contains information about different indications and their dosages. Within this, there's an entry where the indication is both neuropathic pain and generalized anxiety disorder. The dosage details specify that for adults, it's up to 600 mg daily in three divided doses.

So, breaking this down, "up to 600 mg daily" suggests that the maximum dose per day should not exceed 600 mg. It's also mentioned to take it in three divided doses, which means the patient should split the medication into three parts throughout the day for better absorption or as prescribed by a healthcare provider.

I don't see any conflicting information here. The JSON doesn't mention higher dosages being necessary for anxiety over other conditions like neuropathic pain, so 600 mg seems appropriate. Also, since it's divided into three doses, that might be to ensure the medication is well-tolerated or to manage side effects such as dizziness or nausea which are common with pregabalin.

I should make sure there's no other part of the JSON that suggests a different dosage for anxiety specifically. Looking through the other sections like "pregnancy" and "renalImpairment," they don't seem relevant here because we're focusing on adults without pregnancy risks or renal issues mentioned in this context.

Therefore, combining all these points, the correct dosage amount is 600 mg per day, taken in three divided doses. The unit would be milligrams since that's standard for dosages.

{
    "dosage amount": "600 mg",
    "dosage unit": "mg"
