Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage for alendronic acid for treating and preventing postmenopausal osteoporosis in an adult based on the provided JSON input. Let me start by looking through the JSON data carefully.

First, I see that there's a section called "therapeuticPlan" which contains information about different indications and dosages. Within this, there's an entry where the indication is "Treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis". That seems relevant to what I'm looking for.

Looking at the dosage details, it specifies that the patient group is "adult", with a dose of 70 mg once weekly. The route of administration is by mouth. There's also an associated ID and parentId, but those aren't necessary for my answer.

I need to structure this information into a JSON response with keys "dosage amount" and "dosage unit". The dosage amount here is straightforwardâ€”it's 70 mg. The dosage unit would be the frequency combined with the dose, which in this case is once weekly (BW). So I'll combine them as "BW 70 mg".

I should make sure not to include any extra information or explanations, just the plain text JSON as specified. Also, since it's for an adult, that's already covered in the patientGroup field.

Double-checking everything, yes, this seems correct. The JSON structure needs to be properly formatted without markdown, so I'll present it accordingly.

```json
{
    "dosage amount": "70 mg",
    "dosage unit": "BW"
}
```
