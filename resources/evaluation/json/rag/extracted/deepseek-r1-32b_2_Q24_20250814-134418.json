Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage amount and unit of gelatin used as a stabilizer in vaccines for adults based on the provided JSON input. Let me start by carefully reading through the JSON data.

Looking at the structure, there's an array called "therapeuticPlan" which contains different indications and their corresponding dosages. One of the indications is "Stabiliser in vaccines". Under this indication, I should find the dosage information for adults.

In the "dosages" section under that therapeutic plan, there's a patient group specified as "adult". The doseInfo here says "up to 1L intravenously depending on clinical need", and the route is by intravenous infusion. 

Wait, but gelatin is typically used in vaccines not as a volume-based dosage but more as a concentration or amount per vaccine dose. However, based strictly on the JSON provided, it mentions up to 1L for adults via IV. Since the question specifically asks about gelatin as a stabilizer in vaccines, I might need to consider if this is referring to the volume used in the vaccine preparation or administration.

But according to the data given, under "Stabiliser in vaccines", the dosage for adults is up to 1L intravenously. So even though in reality, gelatin in vaccines isn't administered as a liter, perhaps in this context, it's referring to the volume used in the solution or preparation. 

Therefore, I'll extract the dosage amount as "up to 1" and the unit as "L". The JSON should only include these two keys without any additional information.

```json
{
    "dosage amount": "up to 1",
    "dosage unit": "L"
}
