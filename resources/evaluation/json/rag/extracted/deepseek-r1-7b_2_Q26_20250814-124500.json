Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage amount and unit for paracetamol when treating fever in an adult based on the provided JSON input. Let me start by looking through the JSON data carefully.

First, I see that there's a section called "therapeuticPlan" which contains information about different indications and their corresponding dosages. Within this, there's an entry where the patient group is specified as "adult". The dosage details mention "up to 1 g every 6 hours". 

I should make sure that this is indeed for fever. Scanning through the therapeutic plan, I see that one of the indications listed under "indications" is "Fever", so that matches up.

Now, regarding the unit, paracetamol is typically measured in milligrams (mg) or grams (g). In the JSON data provided, the dosage amount is given as "1 g". So, I should convert this to a more standard unit used for dosages. Grams can be converted to milligrams since 1 gram equals 1000 milligrams.

Therefore, the dosage amount would be 1000 mg every 6 hours for adults when treating fever.

```json
{
    "dosage amount": "1000 mg",
    "dosage unit": "mg"
}
