Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage of abacavir for an adult with HIV infection based on the provided JSON data. Let me start by looking through the JSON structure.

First, I see that the main identifier is "abacavir" and the title is also "Abacavir". That's a good start. Now, I need to find where the dosage information is located. Scanning through the keys, there's a section called "therapeuticPlan", which seems relevant.

Inside "therapeuticPlan", there are multiple entries, but each has an "indications" array. The first entry under "indications" is "HIV infection". That's exactly what I'm looking for. So, this therapeutic plan is about using abacavir to treat HIV in adults.

Now, within that same object, there's a "dosages" array. Each dosage has details like patient group, dose info, route of administration, etc. The first entry under "dosages" specifies the "patientGroup" as "adult", which matches the user's query about adult dosing.

Looking at the "doseInfo" field in that dosage object, it says "600 mg daily". That seems straightforward. So, for an adult with HIV infection, the recommended dosage is 600 milligrams per day. The route of administration is oral, as indicated by "By mouth", but since the user only asked about the amount and unit, I don't need to include that part.

I should make sure there's no other information conflicting or providing alternative dosages for adults in this JSON. Scanning through the rest of the therapeuticPlan entries, it seems like each is either for different indications or doesn't specify adult dosage again. So, 600 mg daily is consistent and correct based on the provided data.

I also need to ensure that I'm following the user's instructions correctly. They want a structured plain text JSON with only "dosage amount" and "dosage unit" as keys. No extra information or explanations, just those two fields. So, I'll extract 600 as the dosage amount and mg (milligrams) as the unit.

Double-checking to make sure there are no other dosages mentioned for adults in different contexts within the JSON. The other sections like "pregnancy", "hepaticImpairment", etc., don't provide adult-specific dosages, so I can safely ignore them for this query.

Alright, putting it all together, the dosage amount is 600 and the unit is mg. That should be formatted into a JSON object without any markdown or additional text.

{
    "dosage amount": 600,
    "dosage unit": "mg"
