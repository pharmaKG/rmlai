Alright, so the user is asking about the dosage of abacavir for an adult with HIV infection. They provided a JSON input which includes various details about the drug.

First, I need to locate where the dosage information is in the JSON. Looking at the structure, there's a "therapeuticPlan" array. Inside that, each object has "indications", "dosages", etc.

Under "indications", it mentions HIV infection, which matches the user's query. Now, within "dosages", there are patient groups specified. The user is asking for adults, so I'll look for the entry where "patientGroup" is "adult".

In that dosage entry, the "doseInfo" is given as "600 mg daily". So, the dosage amount is 600 mg and the unit is milligrams (mg). 

I should make sure to extract only these two pieces of information without adding any extra details or explanations. The user wants a plain text JSON with just "dosage amount" and "dosage unit".

Double-checking the JSON structure, I see that it's correctly formatted. No markdown, just plain text as specified.

So, the final answer should be a JSON object containing those two keys with their respective values.

{
    "dosage amount": 600,
    "dosage unit": "mg"
}
