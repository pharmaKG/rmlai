Alright, so I need to figure out the correct dosage of alendronic acid for an adult treating or preventing postmenopausal osteoporosis. Let me start by looking at the provided JSON data.

First, I'll scan through the JSON structure to find where the dosages are mentioned. The key "therapeuticPlan" seems relevant here. Under that, there's an array with one object containing "indications" and "dosages".

The indication matches what we're looking for: "Treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis". Now, under "dosages", there's a patient group specified as "adult", which fits our query.

Looking at the "doseInfo" field, it says "70 mg once weekly". So, the dosage amount is 70 mg. The unit here is milligrams (mg), and since it's taken once a week, the frequency isn't part of the unit but just the amount per dose.

I should make sure there are no other dosages listed for adults in this context. Scanning through, it seems like only one dosage is provided under therapeuticPlan for postmenopausal osteoporosis in adults.

Therefore, the dosage amount is 70 mg with the unit being milligrams.

```json
{
    "dosage amount": "70",
    "dosage unit": "mg"
}
