Alright, so the user is asking about the dosage of amitriptyline hydrochloride for neuropathic pain in adults. Let me look through the provided JSON data to find the relevant information.

First, I'll check the structure of the JSON. It has a key called "therapeuticPlan" which contains an array. Each element in this array represents different therapeutic uses and their corresponding dosages.

Looking into the first element of "therapeuticPlan", there's an "indications" array that includes "Neuropathic pain". That's exactly what the user is asking about. Now, within this, there's a "dosages" array with one entry.

In that dosage entry, I see "patientGroup" set to "adult" and "doseInfo" as "25 mg daily". The route of administration is oral, but since the user didn't ask about that, I can ignore it for now.

So, the key details are 25 mg per day. The dosage amount is 25 mg, and the unit is milligrams (mg). 

I need to structure this into a JSON format as specified: keys "dosage amount" and "dosage unit". No extra information should be included, just these two keys with their respective values.

Double-checking to make sure I'm not adding anything else. Yep, that's all the user needs based on the query.

{
    "dosage amount": 25,
    "dosage unit": "mg"
}
