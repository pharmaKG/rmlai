Alright, so the user is asking about the dosage of paracetamol for an adult with a fever. I need to figure out how much and what unit to use based on the provided JSON.

Looking at the JSON, under therapeuticPlan, there's an indication for Fever. The dosages section specifies "up to 1 g every 6 hours" for adults. So the dosage amount is 1 gram, and the unit is grams.

I should structure this into a plain text JSON with dosage amount and unit as keys. No extra info needed, just the facts.

{
    "dosage amount": "1",
    "dosage unit": "g"
}
