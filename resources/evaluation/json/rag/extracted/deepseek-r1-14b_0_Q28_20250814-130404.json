Alright, so I need to figure out the dosage amount and unit for zilucoplan when used for an adult with Myasthenia gravis. Let me start by looking at the provided JSON data.

First, I'll scan through the JSON structure to find where the dosages are mentioned. The key "therapeuticPlan" seems relevant here. Under that, there's an array containing objects related to specific indications.

Looking deeper into the first object in the therapeuticPlan array, I see it has an "indications" field which includes Myasthenia gravis. That's exactly what we're looking for. Now, within this object, there's a "dosages" array with one entry.

In the dosage entry, the key "patientGroup" is set to "adult," which matches our requirement. The "doseInfo" field provides the specific dosage details: "32.4 mg once daily." This tells me that the dosage amount is 32.4 milligrams (mg), and it's administered once each day.

I should also check if there are any other dosages mentioned, but since this is the only entry under therapeuticPlan for Myasthenia gravis in adults, I can be confident that this is the correct information.

So, putting it all together, the dosage amount is 32.4 mg, and the unit is milligrams.

```json
{
    "dosage amount": "32.4",
    "dosage unit": "mg"
}
