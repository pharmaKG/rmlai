Alright, so I need to figure out the dosage of atorvastatin for an adult with hypercholesterolaemia based on the provided JSON. Let me start by understanding what's given.

Looking at the JSON structure, there's a key called "therapeuticPlan" which contains information about indications and dosages. Under that, I see an indication for "Hypercholesterolaemia". That's exactly what we're looking for.

Now, within the "dosages" array, each entry has details like patient group, dose info, etc. The patient group here is specified as both "adult" and "Adult", which matches our requirement. 

The doseInfo field says "10 mg once daily, adjusted according to response". So, the dosage amount is 10 mg, and it's taken once a day. That seems straightforward.

I should make sure there are no other dosages listed for hypercholesterolaemia in adults. Scanning through, I don't see any other entries, so this must be the correct one.

Therefore, the answer should include "dosage amount" as 10 mg and "dosage unit" as mg.

```json
{
    "dosage amount": "10",
    "dosage unit": "mg"
}
