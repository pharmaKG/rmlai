Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage amount and unit for aciclovir when treating Herpes simplex keratitis in adults. Let me start by looking at the provided JSON data.

First, I'll search through the JSON structure to find where the dosages are mentioned. There's a section called "therapeuticPlan" which contains an array of objects. Each object has "indications" and "dosages". The indication here is "Herpes simplex keratitis", so that's the right place.

Looking at the "dosages" array, there's one entry with "patientGroup": "adult". That's exactly what I need. Now, under "doseInfo", it says: "Apply a 1 cm ribbon of ointment five times daily into the lower conjunctival sac." 

So, the dosage amount is 1 cm and the unit is centimeters (cm). The route is eye application, but since the question only asks for amount and unit, I don't need to include that.

I should make sure there's no other information in the JSON that might affect this. Checking other sections like "renalImpairment" mentions reducing doses, but since it's about adults without specifying impairment, I think 1 cm five times daily is correct as per the given data.

The dosage for aciclovir in adult patients with Herpes simplex keratitis is specified as a 1 cm ribbon applied five times daily.

```json
{
    "dosage amount": "1",
    "dosage unit": "cm"
}
