Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage amount and unit for betaxolol when used for ocular hypotension in adults. Let me start by looking at the provided JSON data.

First, I see that the identifier is "betaxolol" and the title is "Betaxolol". That's good because it confirms we're dealing with the right medication.

Next, I'll check the therapeuticPlan section since that should contain information about how the drug is used. Under therapeuticPlan, there's an indication for "Ocular hypertension", which is related to ocular hypotension as both deal with eye pressure.

Looking at the dosages array within the therapeuticPlan, there's a patientGroup specified as "adult". That matches the user's request for adult dosage. The doseInfo says "1 drop of 0.5% solution in the affected eye(s) twice daily." 

So, breaking that down: each dose is one drop, and it's done twice a day. The concentration is 0.5%, but since the question asks for dosage amount and unit, I think they're referring to how much is administered per dose.

The dosage amount here is "1" because it's one drop each time. The unit would be "drop(s)" as that's the measure used. 

I don't see any other dosages listed for adults in this JSON, so this must be the standard recommendation. Also, there are no mentions of adjustments based on factors like renal or hepatic impairment affecting the dosage here.

So putting it all together, the answer should specify 1 drop as the dosage amount and drops as the unit.

```json
{
    "dosage amount": "1",
    "dosage unit": "drop(s)"
}
