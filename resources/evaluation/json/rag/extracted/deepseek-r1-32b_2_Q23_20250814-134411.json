Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage of flucloxacillin for an adult with pneumonia based on the provided JSON data. Let me start by looking through the JSON structure.

First, I see that under "therapeuticPlan", there's an indication for Pneumonia. The dosages listed are for a child group (10-17 years) at 500 mg every 6 hours orally. But the user is asking about adults, so this isn't directly applicable.

I check if there are any other dosage entries under "therapeuticPlan" but only see the one for children. The JSON doesn't provide specific adult dosages for pneumonia. 

Since the information isn't present in the given data, I can't determine the exact dosage for an adult. Therefore, the answer should reflect that the dosage amount and unit aren't available from this source.

```json
{
    "dosage amount": "Not specified",
    "dosage unit": "Not specified"
}
```
