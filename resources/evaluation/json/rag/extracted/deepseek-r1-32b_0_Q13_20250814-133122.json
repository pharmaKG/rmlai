Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage of amitriptyline hydrochloride for an adult with neuropathic pain based on the provided JSON input. Let me start by looking through the JSON structure.

First, I see that the main identifier is "amitriptyline-hydrochloride" and the title confirms it's Amitriptyline Hydrochloride. The user is asking specifically about the dosage for an adult with neuropathic pain.

Looking at the structure, there's a section called "therapeuticPlan". Inside that, there are indications listed as ["Neuropathic pain"]. Under each indication, there are dosages specified. Each dosage has details like patient group, dose info, route of administration, etc.

I need to find the entry where the indication is neuropathic pain and the patient group is adult. Scanning through, I see that under "therapeuticPlan", the first item has indications as ["Neuropathic pain"]. Then, within dosages, there's an entry with "patientGroup": "adult" and "doseInfo": "25 mg daily".

So, the dosage amount is 25 mg and the unit is mg. The route is by mouth, but since the user only asked for amount and unit, I don't need to include that.

I should make sure there are no other dosages listed for adults with neuropathic pain in case there's a range or alternative doses. But from what I see, it's just 25 mg daily specified here.

Therefore, the answer should be structured as a JSON object with "dosage amount" and "dosage unit" keys.

```json
{
    "dosage amount": "25",
    "dosage unit": "mg"
}
