Alright, so I need to figure out the dosage amount and unit for Betaxolol regarding ocular hypertension in adults based on the provided JSON input. Let me start by looking through the JSON data carefully.

First, I see that the JSON has a section called "therapeuticPlan" which contains information about how the drug is used. Within this, there's an entry under "indications" and "dosages". The "indications" list includes "Ocular hypertension", so that's exactly what we're looking for.

Next, I'll focus on the dosage details. There's a "dosages" array with one object. This object has several keys: "patientGroup", which is set to "adult"; "doseInfo", which states "1 drop of 0.5% solution in the affected eye(s) twice daily". The other keys like "routeOfAdministration" and "id" are also provided, but they're not necessary for determining the dosage amount and unit.

The key piece here is "doseInfo": "1 drop of 0.5% solution... twice daily." So, this tells me that the adult dose is one drop per affected eye, taken twice a day. The concentration mentioned is 0.5%, which might be important for dosing calculations if needed, but since we're only asked for the amount and unit, I can focus on "1 drop" as the dosage amount.

Now, considering units, in medical contexts, drops are often quantified using the standard abbreviation "gtt". So, one drop would typically be written as 1 gtt. This makes it clear that the unit is a drop or drop per eye twice daily.

I should also check if there's any other information about dosages for adults elsewhere in the JSON, but looking through the rest of the data, I don't see additional entries under "dosages" or related sections that provide further details. The only relevant entry is the one under "adult".

Therefore, putting it all together, the dosage amount is 1 drop (or 1 gtt) and the unit is per eye twice daily.

```json
{
    "dosage amount": "1 drop",
    "dosage unit": "gtt"
}
