Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage of pregabalin for an adult with Generalised anxiety disorder based on the provided JSON input. Let me start by understanding what's given.

Looking at the JSON structure, there's a section called "therapeuticPlan" which includes indications and dosages. The indication for Generalised anxiety disorder is listed under the "indications" array along with Neuropathic pain. 

Within the therapeutic plan, there's an entry for adult patients. The dosage information says "up to 600 mg daily in 3 divided doses." So that means the maximum recommended dose is 600 milligrams per day, taken three times a day.

I should extract just the numerical value and the unit from this. The amount is 600 mg, so the dosage amount is 600 and the unit is mg. 

I need to make sure I don't include any extra information or explanations, just the structured JSON with those two keys.

```json
{
    "dosage amount": 600,
    "dosage unit": "mg"
}
```
