Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage amount and unit for co-trimoxazole when treating a leg ulcer infection in an adult. Let me start by looking at the provided JSON input.

First, I see that there's a section called "therapeuticPlan" which contains dosages for different patient groups. The relevant part here is where the patient group is specified as "adult". In that dosage entry, it says the dose is 960 mg every 12 hours by mouth. 

I should make sure this information aligns with standard medical guidelines or recommendations. Co-trimoxazole is commonly used for infections like leg ulcers and typically comes in 900 mg to 1200 mg doses, often taken twice a day. The dosage provided here matches that range.

Also, the route of administration is by mouth, which is correct as it's usually taken orally without needing to be crushed or mixed with anything else.

So putting this together, the dosage amount is 960 mg and the unit is mg (milligrams). I'll structure this into a JSON object with those two keys.

```json
{
    "dosage amount": "960",
    "dosage unit": "mg"
}
```
