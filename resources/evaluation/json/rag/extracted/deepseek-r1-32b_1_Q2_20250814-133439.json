Okay, so I need to figure out if pregabalin can cause delirium or confusion. Let me start by looking at the information provided in the JSON.

First, I see that under the "sideEffects" section, there's a list of common and uncommon effects. The common side effects include dizziness, drowsiness, increased appetite, weight gain, feeling different, confusion, memory impairment (amnesia), tremor, dry mouth, constipation, nausea, asthenia, vision disorder, lethargy, arthralgia, headache, insomnia.

Wait a minute, I see "confusion" listed as one of the common side effects. That directly answers part of the question. Delirium isn't explicitly mentioned here, but confusion is a symptom that can be associated with delirium. However, delirium typically involves more acute changes in mental status, including disorientation and inability to focus, which might not be fully captured by just "confusion."

Looking further, under the uncommon side effects, there's agitation, depression, anxiety, etc., but nothing specific about delirium. The rare side effects include things like Stevens-Johnson syndrome, vision loss, etc., but again, no mention of delirium.

So, based on this data, pregabalin does list confusion as a common side effect. Delirium isn't explicitly listed, so it's either not commonly reported or perhaps considered under another term. Since the question is about whether it can cause delirium or confusion, and confusion is clearly stated, I think the answer would be yes because confusion is a known side effect.

But wait, should I consider if delirium is a separate entity? Delirium is more severe than just confusion; it's an acute state of confusion with disorientation and other cognitive impairments. Since the JSON doesn't mention delirium specifically, maybe the answer is only about confusion. However, since the question combines both, perhaps I should say yes because confusion is present, which can be a component of delirium.

Alternatively, if delirium isn't listed, maybe it's not commonly associated with pregabalin. But given that confusion is a side effect, and delirium often includes confusion as a symptom, it might still be possible. However, without explicit mention, I'm uncertain whether to say yes or no for delirium.

But the question asks if pregabalin can cause either delirium OR confusion. Since confusion is listed, the answer should be yes because at least one of them (confusion) is a known side effect.
