Okay, so I need to figure out if bilastine can be given to a 15-year-old child based on the provided JSON data. Let me start by understanding what's in the JSON.

Looking at the structure, there's an identifier which is "bilastine". The title is also "Bilastine". Then there are several sections like breastFeeding, hepaticImpairment, pregnancy, renalImpairment, sideEffects, therapeuticPlan, id, and parentId. 

I'm particularly interested in the therapeuticPlan section because that's where dosages for different patient groups should be listed. Let me check that.

In the therapeuticPlan array, there's an object with "indications" as allergic rhinitis and urticaria. Under "dosages", there's a detailedPatientGroup specified as "Child (12–17 years)". The doseInfo says 20 mg once daily, taken after food or fruit juice, by mouth.

Since the child is 15 years old, they fall within the 12-17 age range mentioned. There are no specific warnings against using bilastine for this age group in the provided data. Other sections like breastFeeding and pregnancy have limited data but don't directly affect a 15-year-old's use unless it's related to other conditions, which aren't specified here.

So, based on the therapeuticPlan information, it seems that bilastine is indicated for children aged 12-17 years with allergic rhinitis or urticaria. The dosage provided is suitable for this age group. There are no red flags in the given data suggesting contraindications for adolescents.
