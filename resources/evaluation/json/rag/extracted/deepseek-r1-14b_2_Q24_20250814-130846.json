Alright, so I need to figure out the dosage amount and unit for gelatin when used as a stabilizer in vaccines for adults. Let me start by looking at the provided JSON data.

First, I'll scan through the JSON structure to find any relevant information about dosages. The main section that seems promising is "therapeuticPlan". Under this, there's an array with one object containing "indications" and "dosages".

Looking at the "indications", I see three uses: "Low blood volume", "Pharmaceutical excipient (capsules, tablets)", and "Stabiliser in vaccines". Since we're interested in gelatin as a stabilizer in vaccines, this is exactly what we need.

Next, I'll check the "dosages" array. It has one entry with several details. The key parts here are "patientGroup", which specifies that it's for adults, and "doseInfo", which gives the dosage specifics. The dose info says "up to 1L intravenously depending on clinical need". 

Wait a minute, this seems like a large volumeâ€”1 liter? That doesn't sound right for a vaccine stabilizer. Typically, vaccines are in much smaller doses. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the context here. Gelatin is often used as an excipient in pharmaceuticals and can be part of the formulation rather than administered directly as a treatment.

But according to the JSON data provided, under "therapeuticPlan", it's listed as a dosage for intravenous use up to 1L. However, since we're specifically looking at its role as a stabilizer in vaccines, perhaps the dosage isn't something that's given directly to the patient but is part of the vaccine formulation itself.

In that case, the dosage amount and unit might not be applicable in the same way because it's an ingredient within the vaccine rather than a separate treatment. But since the JSON data includes this under "dosages", I have to go with what's provided there.

So, based on the information given, for an adult, the dosage amount is up to 1 liter and the unit is intravenously. However, this seems contradictory because administering 1L of gelatin as a stabilizer in a vaccine doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a mistake or misinterpretation in the data.

Alternatively, perhaps "up to 1L" refers to the total volume of the solution used during manufacturing or another context, not the actual dose given to the patient. But since I have to follow the provided JSON strictly, I'll extract the dosage as stated.

Therefore, the answer should be structured with "dosage amount" as "up to 1L" and "dosage unit" as "intravenously".

```json
{
    "dosage amount": "up to 1L",
    "dosage unit": "intravenously"
}
