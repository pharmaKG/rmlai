Alright, so I need to figure out the dosage of aciclovir for an adult with Herpes simplex keratitis based on the provided JSON. Let me start by understanding what's given.

Looking at the JSON structure, there's a section called "therapeuticPlan" which contains information about different uses and their respective dosages. Under that, I see an indication for "Herpes simplex keratitis". That's exactly what we're looking for.

Now, within this indication, there's a dosage array with one entry. The patient group is specified as "adult", so that's perfect because the question is about adults. The doseInfo field says to apply a 1 cm ribbon of ointment five times daily into the lower conjunctival sac. 

Wait, but the question asks for the dosage amount and unit. In this case, it's an ointment application. So, the amount is 1 cm and the unit would be "cm" or perhaps "ribbon". But usually, dosages are given in more standard units like grams or milliliters. However, since it's a ribbon of ointment, specifying the length makes sense.

I should make sure that I'm extracting the correct values without adding any extra information. The JSON structure requires only "dosage amount" and "dosage unit". So from the doseInfo, it's 1 cm ribbon applied five times daily. Therefore, the dosage amount is 1 cm, and the unit is cm.

I don't see any other dosages for adults in this context, so that should be the answer.

```json
{
    "dosage amount": "1 cm",
    "dosage unit": "cm"
}
