Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage of zilucoplan for an adult with Myasthenia gravis based on the provided JSON input. Let me start by understanding what's given.

Looking at the JSON structure, there are several sections like breastFeeding, hepaticImpairment, pregnancy, etc., but the key part I need is under "therapeuticPlan". That section has an array of objects, each with indications and dosages.

The indication here is Myasthenia gravis. Under that, in the dosages array, there's a patientGroup specified as "adult" and detailedPatientGroup as "Adult (body-weight 77 kg and above)". The doseInfo says "32.4 mg once daily", and it's administered subcutaneously.

So, for an adult with Myasthenia gravis, the dosage is 32.4 mg each day via injection under the skin. I don't see any other dosages mentioned for adults in this context, so that must be the correct one.

The dosage amount is 32.4 mg and the unit is milligrams (mg) administered once daily by subcutaneous injection.

```json
{
    "dosage amount": "32.4",
    "dosage unit": "mg"
}
