Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage information for Bilastine regarding allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and urticaria. Let me start by looking at the provided JSON input.

First, I see that the drug is called "Bilastine" with an identifier of "bilastine". The title is just "Bilastine", so that's straightforward.

Looking under "pregnancy", there's a note saying limited data and it should be avoided. That doesn't directly help me with dosages, but it's good to know.

Next, the "sideEffects" section mentions urticaria as an uncommon effect, which is relevant since the user is asking about urticaria.

The main part I need to focus on is under "therapeuticPlan". There's a list of indications where "Urticaria" is included. The dosage information provided there specifies that for children aged 12-17 years, the dose is 20 mg once daily, taken after food or fruit juice.

Since the question is about an adult, I need to determine if this dosage applies to adults as well. The therapeutic plan only provides dosages for a child's group, so it might not directly apply to adults. However, in many cases, adult dosages are similar unless specified otherwise.

I should also consider whether Bilastine typically has different dosages for adults versus children. Without explicit information, I'll assume that the dosage provided is suitable for adults as well, but with a note of caution if they have specific conditions or concerns.
