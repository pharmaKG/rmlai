Alright, so I need to figure out the dosage for bilastine for an adult. The user is asking specifically about the amount and unit for symptomatic relief of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and urticaria.

Looking at the provided JSON data, under the "therapeuticPlan" section, there's a dosage listed for children aged 12â€“17 years: 20 mg once daily. But I'm supposed to find the adult dosage.

Hmm, since the JSON doesn't provide explicit information about adults, I might need to infer or recall typical dosages for bilastine. From what I know, bilastine is an antihistamine that's often used in adults at a standard dose of 20 mg once daily. It's usually taken orally, either with food or fruit juice to help absorption.

I should check if there are any contraindications or special considerations for adults, but the JSON doesn't mention anything specific. So, it's safe to go with the commonly recommended adult dosage.

```json
{
    "dosage amount": 20,
    "dosage unit": "mg"
}
```
