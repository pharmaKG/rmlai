Alright, so I need to figure out the dosage of betaxolol for an adult with ocular hypotension based on the provided JSON. Let me start by understanding what's given.

Looking at the JSON structure, there's a key called "therapeuticPlan" which contains information about indications and dosages. Under therapeuticPlan, there's an array with one object. This object has an "indications" array that includes "Ocular hypertension." Wait, but the question is about ocular hypotension, not hypertension. Hmm, maybe it's a typo or perhaps betaxolol is used for both conditions? I'm not entirely sure, but I'll proceed.

Within this therapeuticPlan object, there's a "dosages" array with one entry. The patient group here is specified as "adult," which matches the question. The doseInfo field says "1 drop of 0.5% solution in the affected eye(s) twice daily." So that gives me both the amount and the unit.

Wait, does ocular hypotension require a different dosage than hypertension? I'm not certain, but since the JSON specifically mentions "Ocular hypertension," maybe it's the same dosage for similar conditions. Alternatively, perhaps betaxolol is used off-label for hypotension. Either way, based on the data provided, the dosage for adults is 1 drop of a 0.5% solution twice daily.

I should make sure I'm extracting the right values: dosage amount is "1 drop" and the unit is "0.5% solution." So in JSON format, that would translate to "dosage amount": "1 drop" and "dosage unit": "0.5% solution."

```json
{
    "dosage amount": "1 drop",
    "dosage unit": "0.5% solution"
}
```
