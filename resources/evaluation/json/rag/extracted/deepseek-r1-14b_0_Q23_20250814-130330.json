Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage of flucloxacillin for an adult with pneumonia based on the provided JSON. Let me start by looking through the JSON data carefully.

First, I see that the JSON has a section called "therapeuticPlan". Inside that, there's an indication for "Pneumonia". Under that, there are dosages listed. However, each dosage specifies the patient group as "child" with a detailed age of 10-17 years and a dose of 500 mg every 6 hours orally.

Hmm, the question is asking about an adult dosage. Since the provided data only mentions the child dosage for pneumonia, I don't see any information regarding adults here. Maybe flucloxacillin isn't typically used in adults for pneumonia, or perhaps it's not included in this dataset.

I should check if there are other sections that might have adult dosages indirectly. Looking through the JSON again, I see sections about hepatic impairment, renal impairment, pregnancy, and breastfeeding, but none of these seem to provide dosage information for adults specifically.

Wait, maybe flucloxacillin is primarily used in children or perhaps it's not commonly prescribed to adults for pneumonia. Alternatively, the data might just not include adult dosages. Since the question asks for an adult, but the JSON only has child data, I can't provide a specific dosage amount and unit for an adult based on this information.

I should probably note that there's no adult dosage provided in the given JSON. However, since the user is asking for a structured JSON response with dosage details, even if it's not present, I might have to represent that somehow. But according to the rules, I shouldn't include any additional explanations, just provide the answer as per the data.

Since the data doesn't specify adult dosages, maybe I should indicate that no information is available or perhaps return an empty JSON. However, the user expects a dosage amount and unit, so perhaps it's better to state that there's no data available for adults in the response.

But looking back at the rules, they say to provide the answer in a structured plain text JSON with "dosage amount" and "dosage unit". If I can't find any adult dosage info, maybe I should omit those keys or set them to null. However, that might not be accurate because the user expects specific values.

Alternatively, perhaps flucloxacillin is used off-label in adults for pneumonia, but without explicit data here, it's hard to say. Since the JSON only provides child dosages, I can't accurately provide an adult dosage based on this input.

In conclusion, since there's no adult dosage information available in the provided JSON, I should either indicate that or perhaps infer a possible adult dose if known, but without explicit data, it's risky. Given the rules, I think the best approach is to state that no dosage information is available for adults based on the given data.

```json
{
    "dosage amount": null,
    "dosage unit": null
}
