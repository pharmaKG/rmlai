Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the dosage amount and dosage unit for gelatin used as a stabilizer in vaccines for an adult. Let's start by looking at the provided JSON data.

First, I see that there's an entry under "therapeuticPlan" which includes different indications and dosages. The relevant indication here is "Stabiliser in vaccines." Looking into the "dosages" array within this therapeutic plan, there's a dosage specified for adults: up to 1 liter intravenously depending on clinical need.

Now, I need to determine what the actual dosage amount is and its corresponding unit. The JSON mentions "up to 1L," which stands for liters. So, the dosage amount would be 1 liter. However, in pharmaceutical contexts, it's common to specify dosages in smaller units like milliliters (ml) or even micrograms per kilogram (mcg/kg). Since gelatin is typically administered in volume measurements, especially when used intravenously, using liters makes sense here.

But wait, 1 liter seems quite high for a vaccine stabilizer. Maybe it's referring to the concentration? Or perhaps it's based on specific dosing guidelines where gelatin is used at such volumes. I should cross-check this information with standard medical references or guidelines related to vaccine preparation.

Assuming that the dosage provided in the JSON is accurate, and considering that 1 liter might be a standard dose for certain stabilizers when administered intravenously, especially if it's food-grade or used as an excipient, then the dosage unit would indeed be liters. However, I should also consider whether this is per kilogram of body weight or just a general maximum volume.

Looking back at the JSON, there's no mention of body weight adjustment, so it seems like 1 liter is the specified amount for adults without further customization based on individual weight. Therefore, the dosage unit would be liters (L), and the dosage amount would be 1 L.

    "dosage amount": "1",
