Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage amount and unit for aciclovir in treating herpes simplex keratitis for an adult based on the provided JSON input. Let me start by looking through the JSON data carefully.

First, I see that there's a section called "therapeuticPlan" which contains dosages for different patient groups. The relevant part here is where the patient group is specified as "adult". In this case, the dosage information says to apply a 1 cm ribbon of ointment five times daily into the lower conjunctival sac.

I also notice that there's another section under "renalImpairment" which mentions reducing the dose in cases of moderate to severe renal impairment. However, since we're focusing on adults without specific renal impairment mentioned, this might not apply here.

Looking at other sections like "pregnancy" and "hepaticImpairment", they provide warnings but don't specify different dosages for adults beyond what's already covered in the therapeutic plan.

So, putting it all together, the main dosage information is within the "therapeuticPlan" where it clearly states applying 1 cm of ointment five times a day. Since this is a specific instruction about the application method and frequency, I can infer that the dosage amount refers to the quantity (1 cm) and the unit is the type of medication used (ointment).

I don't see any other dosages listed for adults elsewhere in the JSON, so it's safe to conclude that 1 cm is the appropriate dosage.

```json
{
    "dosage amount": "1 cm",
    "dosage unit": "ointment"
}
