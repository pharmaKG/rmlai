Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage of pregabalin for an adult with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try my best.

First, I remember that pregabalin is used for various conditions like neuropathic pain and seizures, but it's also prescribed for anxiety. The user specifically asked about GAD, so I should focus on that context.

I think the dosage can vary based on factors like the patient's condition, weight, and how they respond to the medication. But since this is a general question, I'll look for standard dosages.

From what I recall, pregabalin usually starts at a lower dose to minimize side effects. The initial dose might be around 50 mg or 75 mg per day. Then, it can be increased gradually. I think the maximum recommended dose is higher than that, maybe up to 200 mg or even 300 mg daily.

Wait, but how is this divided? Is it taken once a day or split into doses? I believe pregabalin can be taken either once or twice daily, depending on what's more convenient for the patient. So the total daily dose would still be within that range.

I should also consider if there are any specific guidelines from reputable sources. Maybe checking the prescribing information or clinical practice guidelines could help confirm these numbers. But since I don't have access to those right now, I'll go with what I remember.

So putting it together: the initial dosage is typically 50 mg to 75 mg per day, and it can be increased up to a maximum of 200 mg or sometimes even 300 mg daily. The unit here would be milligrams (mg).

I think that's the general range, but I should make sure there isn't any variation based on factors like age or other health conditions. However, since the question is about adults in general, I'll stick with the standard dosage without considering those specifics.

Alright, so to structure this into JSON as per the user's request: keys are "dosage amount" and "dosage unit". The values would be the range for the initial dose and the maximum. But wait, how should I represent a range? Maybe using a string that indicates the range, like "50-75 mg daily (initial), up to 200-300 mg daily (maximum)".

I need to make sure not to include any extra information or explanations, just the keys and their values. Also, avoid markdown formatting, so plain text JSON is needed.

```json
{
  "dosage amount": "50-75 mg daily (initial), up to 200-300 mg daily (maximum)",
  "dosage unit": "mg"
}
