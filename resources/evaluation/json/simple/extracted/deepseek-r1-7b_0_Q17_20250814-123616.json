Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage for betaxolol for ocular hypertension in adults. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what the correct dosages are off the top of my head, but I can try to work it out.

First, I know that ocular hypertension is a condition where the blood pressure in the eyes is too high, which can lead to vision problems if left untreated. Betaxolol is an antiepileptic drug, right? So maybe it's used for some eye conditions as well.

I remember that medications often have specific dosages based on the patient's weight and the condition being treated. Since this is for adults, I think the dosage would be in milligrams per kilogram of body weight. That makes sense because it allows for a standardized approach across different individuals.

Now, looking at betaxolol specifically, I'm not certain about its exact dosage off the top of my head. But I can try to recall or reason it out. I think it's used in lower doses for eye conditions because higher doses could be too potent and might have side effects like drowsiness or liver issues.

So maybe the dosage is something like 0.5 mg per kilogram, but that seems a bit high. Wait, no, I think it's actually 1 mg per kilogram. That sounds more reasonable for an antiepileptic drug used in lower doses. So if someone weighs 70 kg, they'd take 70 mg of betaxolol.

As for the dosage unit, milligrams (mg) is the standard unit for such medications. It's a metric unit and makes sense because it's precise enough to adjust based on weight without being too cumbersome.

Putting that together, I think the correct JSON would have "dosage amount" as 1 mg/kg and "dosage unit" as mg.

```json
{
  "dosage_amount": "1 mg/kg",
  "dosage_unit": "mg"
}
