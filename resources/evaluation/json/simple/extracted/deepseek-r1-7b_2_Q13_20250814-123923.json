Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage for amitriptyline hydrochloride for neuropathic pain in adults. Hmm, I'm not a doctor, but I know that medications have specific dosages based on the condition they're treating.

First, I remember that amitriptyline is used for various conditions like neuropathic pain, depression, and fibromyalgia. For neuropathic pain, it's probably used to relieve chronic pain. I think the dosage might be in mg per day, but I'm not sure about the exact amount.

I've heard that some antidepressants have lower doses for neuropathic pain, maybe around 50mg? But wait, isn't there a higher dose too? Maybe up to 400mg or something. I should check if both are common.

Also, it's important to note how the dosage is administeredâ€”usually once daily with food, as per some sources. So the unit would be mg, and the amount would vary based on the adult's weight or other factors, but since the question asks for a general dosage, maybe just provide the typical range.

Putting it all together, I think the answer should state that the dosage is between 50mg to 400mg per day as amitriptyline hydrochloride. That covers both lower and higher doses used for neuropathic pain.
