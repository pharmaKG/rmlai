Okay, so I need to figure out if co-trimoxazole can be given while breastfeeding. Hmm, I'm not a medical expert, but I know that some medications are unsafe during breastfeeding. Co-trimoxazole is an antiepileptic drug, right? It's used for seizures.

I remember hearing somewhere that certain drugs should not be taken during pregnancy or breastfeeding because they can harm the developing fetus or newborn. But I'm not sure if co-trimoxazole falls into that category. Maybe it's safer now than before?

Wait, I think there are specific guidelines from agencies like the FDA or WHO about this. They might have updated their advice on co-trimoxazole use during breastfeeding. I should check if there's any information available.

I recall that some antiepileptics are considered safe in limited quantities during breastfeeding, but others aren't. Co-trimoxazole is a newer drug compared to older ones like phenytoin, so maybe it's been studied more recently.

Also, the dosage and duration matter. If someone is breastfeeding, they might need to take smaller doses or stop breastfeeding if the drug is too harmful. But I'm not sure about the specific case of co-trimoxazole.

I should look up the current recommendations from reliable sources like the FDA's NORDIC database or WHO guidelines. That would give me an accurate answer based on the latest research.
