Okay, so I need to figure out if ciclosporin is safe during pregnancy. I'm not very familiar with all the medications, but I know that some antibiotics and antifungals can have side effects when pregnant.

First, I remember that ciclosporin is a type of immunosuppressive drug. It's often used in cases where the immune system needs to be suppressed, like in organ transplants or certain autoimmune diseases. But I'm not sure about its safety during pregnancy.

I think about whether any medications are known to be unsafe when pregnant. I recall that some antibiotics can cause birth defects if taken too early or in large doses. Ciprofloxacin is an example of such a drug, but I don't know about ciclosporin.

Wait, I've heard that some immunosuppressive agents might have risks during pregnancy. Maybe because they affect the fetus's immune system? But I'm not certain if that applies to ciclosporin specifically.

I should check if there are any specific warnings or contraindications for pregnants taking ciclosporin. From what I remember, some sources say that while there isn't a lot of specific information about pregnancy, it might be used in cases where the mother's immune system is severely compromised, like after a severe infection.

But generally, it's probably not recommended to use without medical advice because of potential risks to the fetus and the possibility of drug interactions. So I think the answer would be that it's considered unsafe or unknown but with caution.
