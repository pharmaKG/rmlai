Okay, so the user is asking if ciclosporin is safe during pregnancy. I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I should recall what ciclosporin is used for. It's an immunosuppressive drug, often prescribed after organ transplants or for autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. Now, considering its use in pregnancy, safety is a big concern because of potential risks to the fetus.

I remember that medications can have different effects during various stages of pregnancy. So I should check if there are any studies or guidelines about using ciclosporin while pregnant. From what I know, it's generally not recommended unless absolutely necessary. There might be some reports linking it to birth defects or other complications in the baby.

Also, I should consider alternatives. Are there safer options for managing the condition during pregnancy? Maybe adjusting the dosage or switching to a different medication could be better. It's important to weigh the benefits against the risks because if the mother has an autoimmune disease that's not controlled, that can also pose risks to the pregnancy.

I think the key points are: Ciclosporin isn't considered safe in pregnancy due to potential fetal risks, and it should only be used under strict medical supervision when other options aren't available. So the answer would be no, but with an explanation about the risks involved.
