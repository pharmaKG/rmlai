Okay, so I need to figure out the correct dosage of pregabalin for an adult with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). I'm not a medical professional, but I'll try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that pregabalin is primarily used for conditions like neuropathic pain and anxiety disorders. It's also known under the brand name Lyrica. For GAD specifically, I think it's approved as a treatment, so there should be established dosages.

I recall that medications often start with a low dose to manage side effects and then increase if needed. So maybe pregabalin starts at around 3 mg or something like that? But wait, I'm not sure about the exact amount. Maybe it's higher because I've heard of people taking up to 200 mg for other conditions.

I should check typical dosage ranges. From what I remember, for anxiety, the dosage might start lower and then increase. Perhaps starting at around 3 mg once daily and gradually increasing? Or maybe it's taken more than once a day initially.

Wait, no, I think pregabalin is usually taken three times a day when starting, with each dose being small, like 25 mg or so. That adds up to 75 mg per day. But that seems high for anxiety. Maybe the initial dose is lower and then increased as needed.

I'm getting confused now. Let me think again. For GAD, I believe the typical starting dose is around 3 mg once daily, but sometimes it's split into three doses of 25 mg each. That would total 75 mg daily. Then, if needed, the doctor might increase the dosage up to a maximum of 600 mg per day.

Wait, that seems too high. Maybe I'm mixing it up with other uses like neuropathic pain where higher dosages are used. For anxiety, perhaps the starting dose is lower and doesn't go as high. Let me try to recall any specific studies or guidelines.

I think the FDA-approved dosage for GAD starts at 3 mg once daily, but sometimes divided into three doses of 25 mg each (totaling 75 mg). Then, if necessary, it can be increased by the doctor, but not exceeding a total of 600 mg per day. That seems more accurate.

So, putting this together, the initial dosage is either 3 mg once daily or split into three doses of 25 mg each, totaling 75 mg. The maximum dose would be up to 600 mg per day, but that's under medical supervision.

I should make sure I'm not including any extra information and just provide the structured JSON as requested.
