Okay, so I need to figure out if carbamazepine can be given orally. Carbamazepine is a medication I've heard about before; it's used for antiepileptic purposes, right? I think it's sometimes called Lormetazepam or something similar.

First, I should recall what I know about how medications are administered. Most drugs come in different forms: oral, IV, IM, sublingual, etc. Oral medications are taken by mouth, while others require injection under the skin.

Carbamazepine is an antiepileptic drug (AED), so it's probably designed to be taken orally since many AEDs are. But I'm not entirely sure if there are any exceptions or specific instructions about its administration.

I remember that some medications have specific routes of administration for safety reasons. For example, certain antidepressants might need to be administered slowly to avoid side effects like increased heart rate. But carbamazepine is specifically an AED and is often prescribed with a doctor's supervision.

Wait, I think it's also possible that if someone has a medical condition or is on another medication, they might need to consult their doctor about the best way to take it. Maybe some people can't take it orally for medical reasons, but generally, oral administration seems standard.

So putting this together, carbamazepine is typically taken by mouth as an oral tablet or capsule. There's no indication here that it needs a different route of administration like IV or IM unless specified by a healthcare provider.
