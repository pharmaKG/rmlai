Okay, so I need to figure out if cyclosporin is safe during pregnancy. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about this, but let me think through it.

First, I know that cyclosporin is an immunosuppressive drug, often used after organ transplants or for certain autoimmune diseases. But when it comes to pregnancy, medications can have different effects because the body changes a lot and there's concern about how they might affect the developing fetus.

I remember hearing that some drugs are categorized by their safety during pregnancy, like categories A, B, C, D, X. I think category A is safest, then B, then C, D, and X means it's contraindicated. But I'm not exactly sure where cyclosporin falls.

I should check reliable sources. Maybe the FDA has information on this. From what I recall, cyclosporin isn't classified by the FDA into a specific pregnancy category because there aren't enough studies. That would mean it's in the 'unknown' or 'insufficient data' category.

Wait, but some sources might say that it's used during pregnancy when necessary, especially for conditions like severe organ rejection after transplantation. So even though it's not well-studied, it might be used under certain circumstances with caution.

I should also consider the risks versus benefits. If a woman needs cyclosporin to manage an autoimmune condition or post-transplant, the potential benefits could outweigh the unknown risks. But without sufficient data, it's hard to say definitively if it's safe.

So putting this together, I think the answer is that it's not known whether cyclosporin is safe during pregnancy because there aren't enough studies. Therefore, the answer would be 'unknown' with an explanation about the lack of sufficient human data.
