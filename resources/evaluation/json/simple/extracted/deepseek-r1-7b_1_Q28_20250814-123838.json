Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage for zilucoplan for Myasthenia gravis for an adult. First, I should recall what Myasthenia gravis isâ€”it's a neuromuscular disorder that affects acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. It causes weakness and fatigue.

Zilucoplan is a medication used to treat this condition. From what I remember, it's a cholin muscle relaxant. Now, for dosing, I think it's usually administered subcutaneously because of its mechanism of action.

I believe the typical adult dose might be around 1 mg or 2 mg every 6 hours. But wait, sometimes higher doses are used if the effect isn't strong enough. So maybe up to 4 mg per dose could be considered for some patients.

The dosage unit would then be milligrams (mg). So structuring this into JSON, I should have "dosage amount" as a number and "dosage unit" as the string indicating mg.

```json
{
  "dosage_amount": 1,
  "dosage_unit": "mg"
}
```
