Alright, I need to figure out whether pregabalin can cause delirium or confusion. First, I'll recall what pregabalin is used for. It's primarily prescribed as an anticonvulsant and also used for anxiety and sleep disorders.

I remember that pregabalin works by affecting calcium channels in the nervous system, which helps reduce neuronal activity. Now, considering its mechanism, could this lead to confusion or delirium? I think some central nervous system depressants can cause such side effects because they slow down brain function.

Looking up common side effects of pregabalin, I see that dizziness and drowsiness are listed. These symptoms might contribute to confusion in some cases, especially if the patient is already dealing with other conditions or taking other medications that also cause drowsiness.

I should check if there's any specific mention of delirium associated with pregabalin use. From what I gather, while it's not a primary side effect, there have been reports where patients experienced confusion, particularly at higher doses or when used concomitantly with other drugs like benzodiazepines.

It's also important to note that individual responses can vary. Some people might be more sensitive to the effects of pregabalin, leading to these symptoms. Additionally, if someone stops taking pregabalin abruptly, withdrawal symptoms could include confusion as well.

In summary, while delirium isn't a common side effect, there are cases where pregabalin has been linked to confusion, especially under certain circumstances like high doses or interactions with other medications.
