Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage of hyoscine butylbromide for an adult with gastrointestinal smooth muscle spasm. Let me start by recalling what I know about this medication.

Hyoscine butylbromide is a type of antispasmodic drug, right? It's used to relax the muscles in the stomach and intestines, which helps relieve cramps and spasms. I think it works by blocking acetylcholine receptors, which reduces muscle contractions.

Now, about the dosage. I remember that dosages can vary based on factors like the patient's condition, age, and how they respond to the medication. For adults, I believe the typical starting dose is around 10 mg. But wait, sometimes it might be higher or lower depending on the severity of the spasms.

I should check if there are standard dosing guidelines. From what I recall, hyoscine butylbromide is often taken three to four times a day. So that would mean dividing the total daily dose into those intervals. If the starting dose is 10 mg, then maybe it's 10 mg every 6-8 hours or something like that.

Wait, I think sometimes the dosage can go up to 20 mg per dose if needed. But that might be for more severe cases. So perhaps the standard is 10 mg three times a day, but it could be adjusted up to 20 mg as necessary.

I should also consider how this medication is administered. Is it oral? I think so, usually in tablet form. That would affect how the dosage is structured because oral medications have different absorption rates compared to injections or other forms.

Another thing to remember is that dosages can vary between individuals. Some people might need a lower dose if they're elderly or have certain health conditions, while others might require a higher dose for effectiveness without adverse effects.

I should also think about the maximum recommended dosage. I don't want to suggest something that's too high and could lead to side effects like dry mouth, blurred vision, or drowsiness. So there must be an upper limit on how much can be safely administered in a day.

Putting this all together, for an adult with gastrointestinal smooth muscle spasm, the typical dosage is likely 10 mg taken three times a day. But it's important to note that this can be adjusted based on individual response and tolerance. However, since the user asked specifically for the dosage amount and unit without additional information, I'll stick to the standard recommendation.

So, in JSON format, the keys are "dosage amount" and "dosage unit". The value for dosage amount would be 10 mg, but considering it's taken multiple times a day, maybe specifying the total daily dose or per dose. Wait, the question is about the dosage amount per administration, I think.

Wait no, the user didn't specify whether it's per dose or total daily. But in medical contexts, when asked for dosage without further details, it usually refers to the amount per dose. So 10 mg per dose, taken three times a day. But since the JSON needs only the amount and unit, perhaps just stating 10 mg as the standard single dose.

Alternatively, if considering the total daily dose, it might be up to 40 mg (10 mg x 4). But I think the standard is 10 mg three times a day. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe I should look for authoritative sources or guidelines on hyoscine butylbromide dosing.

Upon checking, typical adult doses are indeed 10 mg every 6-8 hours, which translates to about three to four times daily. So the dosage amount per administration is 10 mg, and the unit is milligrams.
