Okay, so I need to figure out the correct dosage of flucloxacillin for an adult with pneumonia. First, I should understand what flucloxacillin is. It's a type of antibiotic, specifically a cephalosporin, which means it's used to treat bacterial infections. Pneumonia can be caused by various bacteria, so the choice of antibiotic depends on the severity and the likely pathogens involved.

I remember that flucloxacillin is often prescribed for respiratory tract infections because it's effective against many gram-positive bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, which commonly causes pneumonia. Now, regarding dosage, I think it's usually given orally. The standard adult dose might be around 250 mg or 500 mg per tablet.

I should check the typical frequency as well. It's likely taken multiple times a day because cephalosporins are often dosed every 6 to 8 hours. So, if it's 500 mg three times a day, that would be 1500 mg in total daily. Alternatively, sometimes it might be given four times a day for more severe cases.

I also need to consider the duration of treatment. For pneumonia, courses are usually around 7-14 days, but this can vary based on how the patient responds and whether there are any complications.

Wait, I should make sure about the exact dosage amount and unit without including other info as per the user's instructions. So, focusing just on the dosage for an adult with pneumonia, it's typically 500 mg taken three times a day or maybe four times if more frequent dosing is needed. The unit would be milligrams (mg) since that's how antibiotics are usually measured.

I think I've seen in some guidelines that flucloxacillin is often given at 500 mg every 6-8 hours, which translates to three or four doses a day depending on the schedule. So, for simplicity and common practice, 500 mg three times daily seems standard unless adjusted by the physician based on specific patient factors.

I should also note that this is a general guideline and actual dosing can vary. But since the question asks specifically for an adult with pneumonia, I'll stick to the typical dosage without mentioning variations or special cases.
