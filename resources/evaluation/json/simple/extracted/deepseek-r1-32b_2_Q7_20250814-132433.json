Okay, so I need to figure out if bilastine can be given to a 15-year-old child. First, I should understand what bilastine is. From what I remember, it's an antihistamine used for treating allergies like hay fever. Antihistamines are pretty common, but not all of them are suitable for children.

I think the first step is to check if bilastine is approved for use in adolescents. Sometimes medications have specific age restrictions. Maybe I should look up the prescribing information or guidelines for bilastine. If it's approved for adults, does that include teenagers? Or is there a lower age limit?

Also, considering the dosage might be important. Even if it's approved for children, the appropriate dose for a 15-year-old could differ from an adult. I should check if there are specific pediatric dosages or if adjustments are needed based on weight or other factors.

Another thing to consider is any potential side effects in adolescents. Some medications can have different effects on younger people compared to adults. Are there known issues with bilastine in this age group? For example, drowsiness or other adverse reactions that might be more pronounced in teens.

I should also think about whether bilastine is commonly prescribed for children. If it's not a first-line treatment, maybe alternatives are preferred. But the question specifically asks about bilastine, so I need to focus on that.

Looking up some sources, I find that bilastine is approved for adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older. So, yes, a 15-year-old would fall into that category. The dosage might be the same as for adults since they're in the adolescent range where adult dosages are typically used unless specified otherwise.

I should also consider any contraindications or precautions. For instance, if the child has certain medical conditions or is taking other medications, that could affect whether bilastine is suitable. But without specific information about the child's health, I can only go off general guidelines.

In summary, based on typical approval ranges and usage, bilastine can be given to a 15-year-old as it's approved for adolescents in that age group. However, it's always best to consult a healthcare provider to ensure it's appropriate for the individual child.
