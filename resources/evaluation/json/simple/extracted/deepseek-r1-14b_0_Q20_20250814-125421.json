Okay, so I need to figure out the correct dosage of cefadroxil for an adult with a skin infection. First, I should recall what cefadroxil is. It's an antibiotic, specifically a cephalosporin, which means it's used to treat bacterial infections. Since it's being prescribed for a skin infection, I'm assuming the bacteria involved are susceptible to this drug.

I remember that antibiotics have different dosages based on the patient's age, weight, and the severity of the condition. For adults, the typical dosage might be around 500 mg or 1 gram per dose. But wait, how many times a day is it taken? Usually, cephalosporins can be given every 8 to 12 hours depending on the drug's half-life.

Looking up cefadroxil specifically, I think it's typically administered twice daily. So if each dose is 500 mg, then two doses would make 1 gram per day. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact amount. Maybe it's higher? Some sources might recommend a higher dosage for more severe infections.

I should also consider the weight of the adult. If the person is overweight or underweight, the dosage might need adjustment. However, since the question doesn't specify individual factors like weight or kidney function, I'll assume an average adult dose.

Another point to remember is that cefadroxil can be taken with or without food, but consistency is key. It's important for the patient to take it as prescribed to ensure effectiveness and avoid resistance.

Wait, I think I read somewhere that the usual adult dosage is 500 mg every 12 hours. So that would translate to two doses a day, each of 500 mg. That makes sense because it maintains effective drug levels in the blood without causing toxicity.

I should also check if there are any special considerations, like interactions with other medications or potential side effects. But since the question is only about dosage amount and unit, I can focus on that part.

So putting it all together, for an adult with a skin infection, cefadroxil is typically given as 500 mg twice daily. That would be the dosage amount, and the unit is milligrams.
