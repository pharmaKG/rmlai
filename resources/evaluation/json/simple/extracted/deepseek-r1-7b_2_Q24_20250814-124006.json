Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage amount and dosage unit for gelatin stabilizer in vaccines for adults. Hmm, where do I start? I know that gelatin is often used as a stabilizer in vaccines because it helps maintain the shape of the vaccine components over time.

I remember reading somewhere that the dosage isn't too high since gelatin has a low immunogenicity profile. But what's the exact amount? I think it might be something like 0.1 grams per dose, but I'm not sure about the unit. Is it per kilogram of vaccine or per dose?

Wait, maybe it's specified as micrograms per dose. That sounds more precise. So if it's 0.1 grams, that would actually be 100 milligrams, which is 100,000 micrograms. But I've heard that the actual amount used is much less to avoid any potential immune reactions.

I think the standard dosage for gelatin stabilizer in vaccines is around 5-10 micrograms per dose. That seems more reasonable and aligns with what I remember about vaccine safety. So, if it's 5-10 micrograms, then the unit would be mcg (micrograms).

Putting that together, the dosage amount should be between 5 and 10 mcg, and the dosage unit is mcg per dose. That makes sense because using a higher amount could cause an allergic reaction, but it's necessary to stabilize the vaccine.

I'm pretty confident about this now. So the JSON structure would have "dosage amount" as "5-10 mcg" and "dosage unit" as "mcg". I'll make sure to format it correctly without any extra information.

```json
{
  "dosage amount": "5-10 mcg",
  "dosage unit": "mcg"
}
```
