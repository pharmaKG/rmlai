Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage for aciclovir for Herpes simplex keratitis in adults. Hmm, I remember that aciclovir is used for treating viral infections, especially herpes. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact dosages.

First, I think about what Herpes simplex keratitis is—it's caused by the herpes simplex virus and affects the cornea, right? So the treatment would involve antiviral medication to prevent the spread or relieve symptoms.

I recall that aciclovir is often prescribed for this. Now, the dosage—how much should an adult take? I think it's usually a certain amount per kilogram of body weight. Maybe something like 80 mg/kg? That seems familiar because I've heard similar dosages before in other contexts.

Wait, but how many times a day is that? I believe it's taken twice daily to maintain therapeutic levels without causing side effects. So the total dosage would be calculated based on the patient's weight and divided into two doses per day.

So putting it together: the dosage amount is 80 mg per kilogram of body weight, and it's taken twice a day as one dose. That makes sense because taking it once every 12 hours ensures that the concentration remains effective without being too toxic.

I should double-check if this is correct. Maybe I can think about other sources or previous knowledge—I've heard that for adults, it's around 80 mg/kg per day in two doses. Yeah, that aligns with what I remember.
