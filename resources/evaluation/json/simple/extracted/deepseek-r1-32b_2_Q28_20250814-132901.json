Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage of zilucoplan for an adult with Myasthenia gravis. Hmm, I remember that zilucoplan is a medication used for this condition, but I'm not exactly sure about the specifics.

First, I should probably look up what zilucoplan is. From what I recall, it's a monoclonal antibody, specifically an anti-complement C5 inhibitor. It works by targeting part of the immune system to reduce inflammation and damage in conditions like Myasthenia gravis.

Now, regarding dosage, I think it's given intravenously because many biologics are administered that way. But how often? I believe it's a weekly treatment. So maybe once a week?

As for the amount, I'm not certain about the exact figure. I think it's around 100 mg per dose. That seems familiar from some studies or guidelines I've come across before.

Wait, let me double-check that. If it's 100 mg given weekly via IV, does that make sense? Yes, because higher doses might be too much and lower could be ineffective. So, 100 mg once a week sounds right.

I don't think there are different dosages based on weight or other factors for adults with Myasthenia gravis specifically. It's probably a standard dose regardless of individual differences unless there are specific contraindications or other health issues.

So putting it all together, the dosage amount is 100 mg and the unit is milligrams, given once weekly via IV.
