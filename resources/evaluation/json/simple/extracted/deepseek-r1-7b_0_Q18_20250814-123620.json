Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage for bilastine for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and urticaria in adults. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about this off the top of my head, but let me think through it.

First, I know that bilastine is a medication used for allergies, specifically targeting the nose and eyes. It's an antihistamine, right? So, when dealing with symptoms like sneezing or itching, the dosage would probably be in mg per day.

I remember seeing somewhere that for adults, the typical dose might be around 10 to 25 mg daily. That seems reasonable because higher doses could cause side effects, and lower doses might not be effective enough. But I'm not entirely sure if it's exactly those numbers or a bit different.

Wait, maybe it's 10 mg once a day? Or is it split into two doses of 5 mg each? Sometimes medications are given in smaller doses to avoid potential side effects like dizziness. So perhaps the dosage unit would be mg per dose, and then specify how many times a day.

But looking back at the user's example response, they provided "dosage amount" as 10-25 mg and "dosage unit" as mg. That makes sense because it's common to express dosages in milligrams without specifying the frequency unless necessary.

I should also consider that this information might vary based on the source or the specific formulation of bilastine. Some sources might recommend a higher dose, but 10-25 mg seems standard for adults. Also, I don't recall any major safety issues with taking lower doses of antihistamines, so it's probably safe to go with that range.

So putting it all together, the dosage amount is between 10 and 25 milligrams per day, and the unit is in milligrams.
