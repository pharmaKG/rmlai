Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage of abacavir for an adult with HIV infection. Let me start by recalling what I know about abacavir. It's an antiretroviral drug used in HIV treatment, right? I think it's part of a class called nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). 

Now, the user is asking specifically for adults, so I should focus on adult dosages. From what I remember, abacavir is often prescribed as a combination medication. For example, it's commonly combined with other drugs like lamivudine in a fixed-dose combination tablet. The brand name I think is Epzicom or Kivexa.

As for the dosage amount and unit, I believe the typical adult dose is 600 mg once daily. That makes sense because taking medication once a day can improve adherence. But wait, sometimes dosages vary based on other factors like kidney function or if the patient is also taking other medications that might interact with abacavir.

I should double-check to make sure I'm not mixing up different drugs. Let me think about other NRTIsâ€”like zidovudine or tenofovir. No, those have different dosages. Abacavir's standard dose is indeed 600 mg once daily for adults. It can be taken with or without food, which adds to its convenience.

I also recall that abacavir has a boxed warning about the risk of hypersensitivity reactions. Patients should be monitored for symptoms like fever, rash, or other allergic signs. But since the question is only about dosage, I don't need to include that information here.

So putting it all together, the structured JSON should have "dosage amount" as 600 mg and "dosage unit" as once daily. That's straightforward and meets the user's requirements without any extra details.

```json
{
  "dosage amount": "600 mg",
  "dosage unit": "once daily"
}
```
