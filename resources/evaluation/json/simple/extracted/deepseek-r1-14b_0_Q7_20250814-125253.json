Okay, so I need to figure out whether bilastine can be given to a 15-year-old child. First, I should understand what bilastine is. From what I remember, bilastine is an antihistamine, specifically a second-generation one, which means it's less likely to cause drowsiness compared to first-generation antihistamines. It's commonly used to treat allergies, like hay fever or allergic rhinitis.

Now, considering the age of 15 years old, I should check if there are any specific guidelines regarding its use in adolescents. Since bilastine is approved for adults and older children, but I'm not sure about the exact age restrictions. I think it's generally considered safe for children over a certain age, maybe around 6 or 12, but I'm not entirely certain.

I should also think about the dosage. Typically, medications are adjusted based on weight or age for pediatric use. Bilastine might have specific instructions for younger patients, so without knowing the exact recommendations, it's hard to say definitively. Additionally, I should consider any potential side effects or interactions that might be more significant in a 15-year-old compared to an adult.

I recall that second-generation antihistamines are usually well-tolerated in children, but it's always best to consult a healthcare provider before administering any medication to a child. They can provide personalized advice based on the child's specific health situation and ensure that bilastine is appropriate in this case.

So, putting it all together, while bilastine is commonly used for allergy symptoms and generally considered safe for adolescents, without explicit information confirming its approval or typical use in 15-year-olds, I can't be certain. Therefore, the answer should probably be "unknown" because I don't have specific data on whether it's recommended for that exact age group.
