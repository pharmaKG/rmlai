Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage of apixaban for treating deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) in adults. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try my best.

First, I remember that apixaban is an anticoagulant, which means it helps prevent blood clots. It's used for conditions like DVT and pulmonary embolism. But I'm not exactly sure about the specific dosage details.

I think the usual dose might be around 5 mg or 10 mg twice a day. Wait, isn't there an initial higher dose? Maybe something like 10 mg twice daily for the first few days, then reducing to a lower maintenance dose. Or is it the other way around?

Let me try to recall. I think for DVT, the treatment starts with a higher dose to quickly inhibit clotting and then lowers to prevent further clots. So perhaps the initial dose is 10 mg twice daily for the first 7 days, followed by 5 mg twice daily thereafter.

But wait, could it be that some patients start at 2.5 mg if they have certain risk factors? I'm not sure about that. Maybe that's for different conditions or specific patient populations.

I should also consider how apixaban is takenâ€”like with food or on an empty stomach. But the question only asks about dosage amount and unit, so maybe that's beyond what's needed here.

Putting it all together, I think the standard treatment for DVT in adults with apixaban is 10 mg twice daily for the first week, then reducing to 5 mg twice daily. So the initial dose is higher to kickstart the effect, and then a lower dose maintains it.

I'm pretty confident about this, but I should double-check if there are any exceptions or special cases where the dosage might differ. For example, patients with kidney issues might need adjusted doses, but since the question doesn't specify, I'll stick to the general adult dosage.
