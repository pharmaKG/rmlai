Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage for flucloxacillin when treating pneumonia for an adult. Let me start by recalling what I know about this antibiotic and its uses.

Flucloxacillin is a macrolide antibiotic, right? It's commonly used for infections like pneumonia because it works well against bacteria that cause respiratory issues. Now, dosages can vary based on the patient's age, weight, and the severity of the infection, but I think there are standard guidelines.

I remember that for macrolides, typical doses might be around 500 to 1,000 mg per dose, taken twice a day. But wait, is that correct? Let me think about other antibiotics I know. For example, amoxicillin is usually 400-800 mg twice daily for pneumonia. Since flucloxacillin is similar in mechanism, maybe it follows a similar dosing pattern.

But I should consider the specific information provided earlier. The user mentioned that for adults, the dosage amount ranges from 500 to 1,000 mg and the unit is mg every 8 hours divided into two doses. So combining those, it would be 500-1,000 mg twice a day.

Wait, but sometimes antibiotics have different dosages based on body weight or other factors. However, since the user didn't specify any variations, I'll stick with the standard adult dose they provided: 500 to 1,000 mg every 8 hours divided into two doses per day.

So putting that together, the JSON should have "dosage amount" as a range from 500 to 1000 mg and "dosage unit" as mg twice daily. That makes sense because taking it every 8 hours would mean two doses within a 24-hour period.

```json
{
  "dosage_amount": "500-1000 mg",
  "dosage_unit": "mg twice daily"
}
