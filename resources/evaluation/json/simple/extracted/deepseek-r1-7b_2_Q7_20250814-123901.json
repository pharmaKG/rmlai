Okay, so I need to figure out if bilastine can be given to a 15-year-old child. First, I should understand what bilastine is. From what I remember, it's an antipsychotic medication used for schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.

Now, considering the age of the child, 15 is quite young. I know that medications have different dosages depending on the patient's weight, age, and condition. Since bilastine affects the brain chemistry related to mental health, it's probably not suitable for a child unless there's a specific indication or if they're part of a research study.

I should check if there are any guidelines from medical authorities regarding its use in adolescents. I recall that antipsychotics are generally used in adults with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. There might be some off-label uses, but it's not common practice to start them on children without a specific reason or after consulting a pediatrician.

Also, the side effects could be significant for a child, leading to developmental issues if taken unnecessarily. Therefore, unless there's a clear medical need, it's best to avoid giving bilastine to a 15-year-old.
