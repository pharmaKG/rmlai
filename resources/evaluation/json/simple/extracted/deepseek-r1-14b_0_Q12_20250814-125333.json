Okay, so I need to figure out the correct dosage of alendronic acid for an adult treating or preventing postmenopausal osteoporosis. Let me start by recalling what I know about this medication.

Alendronic acid is a bisphosphonate, which is commonly used to treat and prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. It works by inhibiting bone resorption, thereby increasing bone mineral density. 

I remember that the typical dosage for alendronate (like Fosamax) is usually taken once weekly. The standard dose I think is 70 mg once a week. But wait, sometimes it's also available in a daily formulation, but the weekly one is more common and convenient.

Wait, no, actually, there are different dosages depending on whether it's for treatment or prevention. Or maybe not? Let me check my memory. I think both uses might have the same dosage. So 70 mg once weekly is standard. 

I should also consider how it's takenâ€”on an empty stomach with water, and then avoiding food and drinks for a certain period afterward to prevent GI issues.

But the question specifically asks about dosage amount and unit, so I don't need to include administration details unless they're part of the keys. The JSON should just have "dosage amount" and "dosage unit".

So putting it together, the dosage is 70 mg once a week. Therefore, the amount is 70 mg, and the unit is milligrams.

```json
{
  "dosage amount": "70 mg",
  "dosage unit": "milligram"
}
