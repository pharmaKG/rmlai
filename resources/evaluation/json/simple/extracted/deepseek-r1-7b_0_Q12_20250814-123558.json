Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage for alendronic acid for treating and preventing postmenopausal osteoporosis in adults. Let me start by recalling what I know about this medication.

Alendronic acid is a bisphosphonate, right? It's used mainly for bone diseases like osteoporosis because it helps the body break down calcium and phosphate, which are involved in bone formation and maintenance. For postmenopausal osteoporosis, it's often prescribed to prevent further bone loss after menopause.

I remember that dosages can vary based on factors like the patient's weight, medical history, and how their body responds to the medication. But generally, I think there's a standard starting dose for adults. Maybe around 25 mg or something similar? Wait, wasn't it sometimes higher?

Oh right, sometimes it's given as 10 mg once daily in the evening because of its side effects, like nausea and constipation. That makes sense because higher doses can cause more side effects. So maybe the standard dose is 25 mg twice a day or 30 mg twice? I'm not entirely sure.

I should also consider that the dosage might be adjusted based on the patient's response. For example, if someone isn't absorbing it well, they might need a lower dose initially and then increased over time under a doctor's supervision.

Wait, another thought: is there a maximum daily dose for alendronic acid? I think it's around 60 mg per day because higher doses can lead to bone-related side effects like hypercalcemia. So the total daily dose shouldn't exceed that.

Putting this together, the typical starting dose might be 25 mg twice a day or up to 30 mg twice a day for adults with postmenopausal osteoporosis. That way, they get enough without exceeding the maximum safe dose.

I should double-check these numbers because it's crucial to provide accurate information. From what I recall from medical sources, yes, 25-30 mg twice daily is standard. So that would be the dosage amount and unit.
