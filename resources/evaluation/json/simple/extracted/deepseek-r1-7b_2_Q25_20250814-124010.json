Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage for hyoscine butylbromide to treat gastrointestinal smooth muscle spasm in adults. Hmm, I'm not exactly an expert on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that butylbromide is a local anesthetic and also used topically, like in eye drops. But when it comes to internal use for gastrointestinal issues, I'm less sure. Maybe it's used as a topical agent? Wait, no, the user mentioned gastrointestinal smooth muscle spasm, which sounds more like an internal application.

I think smooth muscle spasm can occur in conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), where the muscles in the gut are spasming. Hyoscine butylbromide is known to relax smooth muscles, so it might help reduce these spasmations.

Now, about dosing. I'm not sure of the exact dosage amounts. I think for topical use, like eye drops, the concentration is usually around 0.1% or similar. But since this is internal, maybe a lower concentration would be used to avoid side effects.

I've heard that sometimes it's applied as a paste or ointment internally. So perhaps the dosage unit would involve a specific amount per area of application. Maybe something like 2 mg per gram of product? That seems plausible because higher concentrations can have adverse effects, especially in adults who might metabolize it differently than children.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the exact figure. It could be that the dosage is lower to ensure safety. Maybe 1-2 mg per gram when applied topically. That way, you don't get a high enough concentration to cause issues like skin irritation or dizziness.

I should also consider that this information might vary based on the source or the specific application method. So it's probably best to look up a reliable source for exact dosages, but since I'm just trying to provide an estimate here, 1-2 mg per gram seems reasonable.
