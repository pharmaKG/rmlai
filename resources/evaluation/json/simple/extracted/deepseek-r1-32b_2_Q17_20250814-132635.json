Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage of betaxolol for an adult with ocular hypotension. Hmm, I remember that betaxolol is a beta-blocker used in eye drops to treat glaucoma and other conditions where reducing intraocular pressure is necessary.

First, I should check what the typical dosage is. From what I recall, it's usually administered topically, meaning as eye drops. The common dosages for such medications are often 0.25% or 0.5%. But wait, betaxolol specifically... I think it's typically prescribed at a lower concentration because beta-blockers can have systemic side effects if absorbed too much.

So, maybe the standard dosage is one drop in each affected eye twice daily. That would mean two times a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact amount per dose. Is it 0.25% or 0.5%? I think 0.25% is more common for betaxolol to minimize side effects.

Wait, let me double-check. Betaxolol hydrochloride eye drops are usually available in 0.25% concentration. The typical regimen is one drop into the affected eye(s) twice daily. So that would be two doses a day, each consisting of one drop per eye.

I should also consider if there's any variation based on the severity of the condition or patient response. But generally, starting with 0.25% once or twice daily is standard. If the intraocular pressure isn't adequately controlled, the dosage might be adjusted under medical supervision.

So putting it all together, the dosage amount would be one drop per eye each time, and the unit would be drops. Since it's twice a day, that's two doses. But in terms of the JSON structure requested, I think they just want the amount per dose and the unit.

Therefore, the structured answer should specify "dosage amount" as 1 drop and "dosage unit" as drops.
