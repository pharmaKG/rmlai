Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage of abaloparatide for constipation in adults. Hmm, first off, I'm a bit confused because I know abaloparatide is primarily used for treating osteoporosis. It's a medication that helps increase bone density by stimulating bone formation and reducing bone breakdown.

Wait, but the question is about using it for constipation? That doesn't ring a bell. Maybe there's some off-label use or perhaps it's a mix-up with another drug. I should double-check if abaloparatide has any known uses related to digestion or the gastrointestinal system.

I'll start by recalling what abaloparatide does. It's a recombinant parathyroid hormone-related protein, which means it works similarly to parathyroid hormone but is more potent and longer-lasting. Its main role is in bone health, so I don't think it's approved for constipation.

Let me think about other medications used for constipation. There are fiber supplements like psyllium, osmotic laxatives such as magnesium hydroxide, stimulants like senna or bisacodyl, and maybe some newer drugs like lubiprostone or linaclotide. None of these seem related to abaloparatide.

Perhaps the user is confusing it with another medication that sounds similar? Or maybe there's a recent study I'm not aware of where abaloparatide has shown benefits for constipation. I should check medical databases or reliable sources to confirm if such usage exists.

Looking up, I find that abaloparatide is indeed only FDA-approved for treating postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and for men at risk of fractures. There's no mention of it being used for gastrointestinal issues like constipation. So, using it for constipation would be off-label, which means there's no established dosage for that purpose.

If a doctor were to consider abaloparatide for an off-label use, they'd have to determine the dosage based on clinical judgment and research. But since there's no standard recommendation, I can't provide a specific dosage amount or unit here.

I should also consider the route of administration. Abaloparatide is typically given via subcutaneous injection, usually once weekly. For constipation, if someone were to hypothetically use it, would the route change? Probably not, but again, there's no evidence supporting this use.

In conclusion, abaloparatide isn't indicated for constipation, so there's no established dosage. The user might have mixed up the drug name or intended a different treatment.
