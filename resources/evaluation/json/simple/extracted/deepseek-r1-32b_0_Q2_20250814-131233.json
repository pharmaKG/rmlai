Okay, so I need to figure out whether pregabalin can cause delirium or confusion. Let me start by recalling what pregabalin is. It's a medication used for treating conditions like neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and sometimes anxiety. I remember it works on the nervous system, specifically affecting neurotransmitters.

Now, thinking about side effects. Common ones include dizziness, drowsiness, and dry mouth. But can it lead to more serious issues like delirium or confusion? Delirium is a state of mental confusion that can come on suddenly, often due to illness or medication. It's different from chronic confusion.

I should check if pregabalin has been linked to such effects. From what I know, central nervous system depressants can cause confusion because they slow down brain activity. Pregabalin does affect the CNS, so it might have that potential. There are case reports where patients on pregabalin experienced confusion or delirium, especially in higher doses or in vulnerable populations like the elderly.

Also, withdrawal from pregabalin can sometimes lead to symptoms like anxiety and confusion, but that's a bit different. The question is about whether taking it can cause these issues directly. So yes, there are documented cases where pregabalin use was associated with delirium or confusion, though it might not be common for everyone.

So putting it all together, the answer should be yes because there are reports linking pregabalin to causing delirium or confusion in some patients.
