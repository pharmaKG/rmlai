Okay, so I need to figure out whether carbamazepine can be given orally. Let me start by recalling what I know about this medication.

Carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant drug, right? It's commonly used to treat conditions like epilepsy and trigeminal neuralgia. From what I remember, most medications that are taken for chronic conditions like these are available in oral forms because it's the most convenient and common route of administration.

I think carbamazepine comes in tablet form. I've heard people take it by mouth, so that would be orally. There might also be other forms, but at least the standard form is oral. I don't recall seeing any information about it being given via injection or another method as a primary route. It's possible there are special cases where it's administered differently, but generally, it's an oral medication.

I should check if there are any specific instructions regarding its administration. From what I know, the usual dosage is taken by mouth with food to reduce stomach upset. So yes, it's definitely given orally in standard practice.
