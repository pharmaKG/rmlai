Okay, so I need to figure out the correct dosage of aciclovir for an adult with Herpes simplex keratitis. Hmm, I'm not a medical expert, but I'll try to think this through.

First, I know that aciclovir is commonly used to treat herpes infections, including those affecting the eyes. But I'm not exactly sure about the specific dosage for keratitis. Maybe I should start by recalling what Herpes simplex keratitis is. It's a viral infection of the cornea caused by the Herpes simplex virus type 1, right? And it can lead to serious eye problems if not treated properly.

I remember that aciclovir is often administered as an ophthalmic solution or an ointment for such infections. But wait, sometimes it might be given systemically in severe cases. So I need to consider both possibilities: topical and oral administration.

For topical use, the dosage strength might vary. I think typical concentrations are around 3% or maybe higher. As for how often to apply it, probably several times a dayâ€”like every few hours. Maybe eight times a day? That sounds familiar from some medications.

If the infection is severe or if there's a risk of corneal scarring, oral aciclovir might be prescribed instead. The dosage in that case would likely be higher and taken more frequently. I think oral doses are usually given every four to six hours, but I'm not certain about the exact amount.

Wait, I should also consider the patient's weight and any other medical conditions they might have. But since the question is general for an adult, maybe it's a standard dosage without considering individual factors.

I'm trying to remember if there are specific guidelines from reputable sources like the CDC or professional ophthalmology organizations. They probably recommend either 3% aciclovir eye drops or ointment several times daily. Oral aciclovir might be in the range of 400 mg to 800 mg five times a day, but I'm not entirely sure.

I should also think about the duration of treatment. Usually, antiviral therapy for herpes keratitis is continued until the infection is controlled and then maybe for a few days longer to prevent recurrence. But again, the question is just about dosage amount and unit, so perhaps that's beyond what's needed here.

Putting it all together, I think the typical dosage for topical aciclovir would be 3% solution or ointment applied multiple times a day, maybe eight times. For oral, if necessary, it might be around 400 mg to 800 mg five times daily. But I'm not entirely confident about these numbers without checking a reliable source.

Wait, another thought: sometimes the dosage is adjusted based on the severity or response to treatment. So it's possible that the exact amount can vary under medical supervision. Also, for ophthalmic solutions, the frequency might be every hour while awake, which could add up to eight times a day.

I think I've covered the main points. Now, I'll structure this into JSON as per the user's request.

```json
{
  "dosage amount": "3% solution or ointment",
  "dosage unit": "topical application (e.g., eye drops or ointment)"
}
```
