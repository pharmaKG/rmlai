Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage for betaxolol when treating an adult with ocular hypotension. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about this, but let me think through it.

First, I remember that betaxolol is a beta-blocker used in eye drops for glaucoma and other eye pressure issues. Ocular hypotension usually refers to low eye pressure, which can sometimes be a side effect of medications or other conditions, so maybe betaxolol isn't typically used here? Wait, no, actually, I think it's more commonly used when the eye pressure is too high, like in glaucoma.

Wait, but the question is about ocular hypotension. Maybe betaxolol isn't the primary treatment for low eye pressure. Perhaps other medications are used instead. But if a doctor does prescribe it for some reason, what would be the dosage?

I think typical doses for adults with glaucoma are usually around 0.5% or maybe 1% solution, given once daily. So maybe that's the case here too. I should check if there's any standard recommendation for betaxolol in cases of ocular hypotension.

Wait a second, actually, betaxolol is more commonly used to reduce high eye pressure, not low. Ocular hypotension might be treated with other medications like alpha agonists or cholinergic agents. But if the question specifically asks about betaxolol for ocular hypotension, perhaps it's being used off-label.

In that case, I think the dosage would still follow what's standard for glaucoma treatment. So probably 0.5% solution, one drop once daily. That seems to be a common starting point.

I should make sure there isn't any specific adjustment for ocular hypotension, but since I don't recall any different dosages, I'll go with the standard glaucoma dose.
