Okay, so I need to figure out the dosage for pregabalin for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) for adults. I'm not a medical professional, but I know that medications have specific dosages based on various factors like weight and condition.

First, I remember that pregabalin is used to treat anxiety, specifically GAD. It's an anticonvulsant, so it helps with both anxiety and seizures if needed. Dosage usually depends on the patient's weight because higher doses are safer for heavier individuals.

I think the starting dose might be lower, maybe around 100 mg or something like that. I've heard that sometimes they start with a smaller dose to monitor how the body reacts before increasing it. So perhaps 50-100 mg once daily is common. But wait, could it be higher? Maybe up to 400 mg if needed.

I should also consider the dosage unit, which would be milligrams (mg). So I'll list two possible amounts: 100 mg and 200 mg, both in mg units. That way, it's clear what each dose represents.

Putting it all together, the JSON structure should have "dosage amount" as an array with these values and "dosage unit" as a string specifying mg.

```json
{
  "dosage amount": [100, 200],
  "dosage unit": "mg"
}
```
